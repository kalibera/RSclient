   o	initial CRAN release - the R client is based on Rserve 0.6-8
	The function names on this old client are in the form RSxxx()

	Included is a new C-based client which uses sockets directly
	and thus supports features that cannot be supported with an
 	R-based client such as TLS/SSL connections, switching,
	RSA secure authentication, multi-client selection.
	The function names for the new client are of the form RS.xxx()

	Handles of the two clients are not interchangeable, so you can
	only use one or the other for one connection.
